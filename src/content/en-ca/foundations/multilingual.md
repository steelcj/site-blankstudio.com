Many sites bolt a second language onto an English original and hope the two stay in step. This one treats every language as its own first-class tree, and links them by meaning rather than by matching paths.

## Independent language roots

Each language lives in its own tree, with its own paths in its own words. The French privacy page is `/fr-ca/mentions-legales/confidentialite/`, not `/fr-ca/legal/privacy/` with the words swapped. The structure reads naturally to a speaker of each language, because it was built in that language, not translated path-by-path from English.

## Paired by identity, not path

Two pages are marked as translations of one another by a shared, stable identifier — a work UUID — not by having the same URL. Names, slugs, and paths change over a site's life; the identifier does not. So the language switcher always lands on the true counterpart, even after a page is renamed or moved.

## Honest about gaps

When a page has no counterpart in the language a visitor asked for, the site says so plainly rather than redirecting them somewhere wrong or showing a dead end. That same gap is surfaced to the site's owner as a build warning and to translators as a to-do, so missing translations are visible work rather than a silent hole.

## Where it maps

This is the *Representation* facet of the *Inclusive* pillar of the Universal Cake Evaluation Metrics: a language is either served properly or its absence is stated honestly — never faked.
